This includes all the dates in August where hand measurements are made.  This dictionary can't be scanned easily in datetime order, but it has accumulated all the tuples.  A single dataframe could be made from this dictionary, but a lot of the entries would be empty, since most datetime entries only contain a subset of the measurements. Measurements are not always at the same time increments, either. The canopy_height and leaf properties, for the most part, are sampled once per day.  These are the only measurements that cover most of the growing season.\n",

However, some tuples are wider than others, since not all measurements were made each time. After reviewing this data distribution, it seems best to create subdictionaries for a certain date range with consistent entries, and then convert the subdictionaries to dataframes.  This manual process is slow, but it will generate a few small, easier to explore and train-on datasets."

    "Sci-kit learn includes a special TimeSeriesSplit operation that takes more of the sequence for training each time, and pulls the 'immediately after training' value for the testing prediction.  This will train on a small subset of the input originally and eventually use most of the input for training.  Overall, it will yield an accuracy representative of querying at any time during the sequence. "

    "The problem of using this on the separated cultivar-range-column models is that very few datapoints are available for training. If we further reduce the number of points through train/test split, accuracy could suffer.  However, it is representative of the data available at each point during the season, so this is realistic.  Let's modify the training above  to use a train/test split.  At the same time, lets one-hot encode the cultivars."
